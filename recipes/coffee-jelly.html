        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Coffee jelly is a dessert made from black coffee and gelatin. Once common in British and American cookbooks, it gained popularity in Japan in the 1960s after a Japanese chain coffee shop branch first made the concoction. Called <em>kohii zerii</em> in Japanese, it is now found in most restaurants and convenience stores throughout the country.</p>
        <p>Coffee jelly is very easy to make: Sweeten strong coffee while heating it, then add a mixture of powdered gelatin and water and let it set up in the fridge. This recipe creates coffee jelly that is light and not too sweet, though you can adjust the sweetness to your liking. It's perfect for dessert, especially following a Japanese dinner in place of or alongside a cup of coffee. It's known as a refreshing Japanese summertime treat, but feel free to enjoy it all year long.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
