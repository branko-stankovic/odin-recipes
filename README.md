# Project: Recipes

## Description:
- A simple html page with some of my favorite recipes
    - Main page, with the heading, a funny gif and links to 3 of my favorite recipes
    - Three subpages with a different recipe on each one, containing an image of the finished dish, a short description of the dish, the necessary ingredients and the steps for making the dish
    - Links to the original recipe sources

## Additional:
- I added a personal touch to this simple webpage using a coffee-like color palette, because all of the recipes had coffee as the main ingredient
- Also, I added a custom made favicon which I made in Aseprite, as a tribute to TheOdinProject (this project is the first one in their curriculum)
